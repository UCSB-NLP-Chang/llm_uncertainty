Question: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles?
Let's think step by step
When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she'll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 = 24
The total number of marbles she'll have is 60+24 = 84
If Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 = 30 frisbees.
If Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she'll have 2/5*30 = 12 more frisbees.
The total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+12 = 42
Bella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = 10 deck cards
If she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she'll have 2/5*10 = 4 more deck cards.
The total number of deck cards she'll have is 10+4 = 14
Together, Bella will have a total of 14+42+84 = 140 items
The answer is 140

Question: A group of 4 fruit baskets contains 9 apples, 15 oranges, and 14 bananas in the first three baskets and 2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket. How many fruits are there?
Let's think step by step
For the first three baskets, the number of apples and oranges in one basket is 9+15=24
In total, together with bananas, the number of fruits in one basket is 24+14=38 for the first three baskets.
Since there are three baskets each having 38 fruits, there are 3*38=114 fruits in the first three baskets.
The number of apples in the fourth basket is 9-2=7
There are also 15-2=13 oranges in the fourth basket
The combined number of oranges and apples in the fourth basket is 13+7=20
The fourth basket also contains 14-2=12 bananas.
In total, the fourth basket has 20+12=32 fruits.
The four baskets together have 32+114=146 fruits.
The answer is 146
